# A Simple SaaS Landing Page

This project marks my first step into web development after learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS through YouTube tutorials and documentation. It was time to put my knowledge into practice and _build something cool_.

## Inspiration

During my research, I discovered **[this tutorial](https://youtu.be/HXYZxVbWkjc?si=YiKduZLCPIQZp3lm)** by **[Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)**, the creator of **[Traversy Media YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@traversymedia?si=Mc2CiCG56Y7tZGeD)**. With over **15+ years of experience**, Brad's tutorial seemed like the perfect guide to learn best practices while building a project.

## Customizations

While following the tutorial, I made some adjustments to suit my current skill level and to add a personal touch:

- **FAQ Section**: Skipped this section as it required JavaScript, which I hadn't learned yet.
- **Responsive Navbar**: Made the navbar responsive for mobile screens without using a hamburger menu.
- **Additional Interactivity**: Added creative interactivity using only CSS to enhance the learning experience.
