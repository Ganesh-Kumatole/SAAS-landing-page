# A Simple SaaS Landing Page

As a beginner, after learning the major concepts of HTML and CSS from Youtube and documentations, it was time...

Time to... _build a cool project._

Or, **My First cool Project.**

So sooner than later after some strategic research on Youtube... I came across **[this tutorial](https://youtu.be/HXYZxVbWkjc?si=YiKduZLCPIQZp3lm)** from **[Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)** (owner of **[Traversy Media YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@traversymedia?si=Mc2CiCG56Y7tZGeD)**) which I decided to follow along... as I was a beginner and I also wanted to learn some best-practices to be followed while coding.

And, learning them from a person having **15+ years of experience** would be amazing!

But, he had used some Javascript as well while building the FAQ Section & Hamburger menu...

And, Since I'd learned just HTML and CSS, I decided to discard the FAQ Section as of now and make the navbar reponsive on mobile-screens without using Hamburger menu...

Also, to make it a more active learning-experience I decided to become a bit creative and add some additional interactivity as well using CSS.
